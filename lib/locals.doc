pygame.locals
pygame constants

This module contains various constants used by Pygame. It's contents are
automatically placed in the pygame module namespace. However, an application
can use pygame.locals to include only the Pygame constants with a
'from pygame.locals import *'.

Detailed descriptions of the various constants are found throughout the
Pygame documentation. pygame.display.set_mode flags like HWSURFACE are found
in the Display section. Event types are explained in the Event section.
Keyboard K_ constants relating to the key attribute of a KEYDOWN or KEYUP
event are listed in the Key section. Also found there are the various MOD_ key
modifiers. Finally, TIMER_RESOLUTION is defined in Time.
