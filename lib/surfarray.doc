pygame.surfarray
pygame module for accessing surface pixel data using array interfaces

Functions to convert pixel data between pygame Surfaces and arrays. This
module will only be functional when pygame can use the external Numpy or
Numeric packages.

Every pixel is stored as a single integer value to represent the red,
green, and blue colors. The 8bit images use a value that looks into a
colormap. Pixels with higher depth use a bit packing process to place
three or four values into a single number.

The arrays are indexed by the X axis first, followed by the Y
axis. Arrays that treat the pixels as a single integer are referred to
as 2D arrays. This module can also separate the red, green, and blue
color values into separate indices. These types of arrays are referred
to as 3D arrays, and the last index is 0 for red, 1 for green, and 2 for
blue.

Supported array systems are

  numpy
  numeric

The default will be numpy, if installed. Otherwise, Numeric will be set
as default if installed. If neither numpy nor Numeric are installed, the
module will raise an ImportError.

The array type to use can be changed at runtime using the use_arraytype ()
method, which requires one of the above types as string.

Note: numpy and Numeric are not completely compatible. Certain array
manipulations, which work for one type, might behave differently or even
completely break for the other.

Additionally, in contrast to Numeric numpy does use unsigned 16-bit
integers. Images with 16-bit data will be treated as unsigned
integers. Numeric instead uses signed integers for the representation,
which is important to keep in mind, if you use the module's functions
and wonder about the values.

The support of numpy is new in pygame 1.8.
<SECTION>

array2d
Copy pixels into a 2d array
pygame.surfarray.array2d(Surface): return array

Copy the pixels from a Surface into a 2D array. The bit depth of the
surface will control the size of the integer values, and will work for
any type of pixel format.

This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
(see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
method).
<END>

pixels2d
Reference pixels into a 2d array
pygame.surfarray.pixels2d(Surface): return array

Create a new 2D array that directly references the pixel values in a
Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the
Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

Pixels from a 24-bit Surface cannot be referenced, but all other Surface
bit depths can.

The Surface this references will remain locked for the lifetime of the
array (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
method).
<END>

array3d
Copy pixels into a 3d array
pygame.surfarray.array3d(Surface): return array

Copy the pixels from a Surface into a 3D array. The bit depth of the
surface will control the size of the integer values, and will work for
any type of pixel format.

This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
(see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
method).
<END>

pixels3d
Reference pixels into a 3d array
pygame.surfarray.pixels3d(Surface): return array

Create a new 3D array that directly references the pixel values in a
Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the
Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

This will only work on Surfaces that have 24-bit or 32-bit
formats. Lower pixel formats cannot be referenced.

The Surface this references will remain locked for the lifetime of the
array (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
method).
<END>

array_alpha
Copy pixel alphas into a 2d array
pygame.surfarray.array_alpha(Surface): return array

Copy the pixel alpha values (degree of transparency) from a Surface into
a 2D array. This will work for any type of Surface format. Surfaces
without a pixel alpha will return an array with all opaque values.

This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied
(see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel access
method).
<END>

pixels_alpha
Reference pixel alphas into a 2d array
pygame.surfarray.pixels_alpha(Surface): return array

Create a new 2D array that directly references the alpha values (degree
of transparency) in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the
pixels in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

This can only work on 32-bit Surfaces with a per-pixel alpha value.

The Surface this array references will remain locked for the lifetime of
the array.
<END>

pixels_red
Reference pixel red into a 2d array.
pygame.surfarray.pixels_red (Surface): return array

Create a new 2D array that directly references the red values
in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels
in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

This can only work on 24-bit or 32-bit Surfaces.

The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
lifetime of the array.
<END>

pixels_green
Reference pixel green into a 2d array.
pygame.surfarray.pixels_green (Surface): return array

Create a new 2D array that directly references the green values
in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels
in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

This can only work on 24-bit or 32-bit Surfaces.

The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
lifetime of the array.
<END>

pixels_blue
Reference pixel blue into a 2d array.
pygame.surfarray.pixels_blue (Surface): return array

Create a new 2D array that directly references the blue values
in a Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels
in the Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

This can only work on 24-bit or 32-bit Surfaces.

The Surface this array references will remain locked for the
lifetime of the array.
<END>

array_colorkey
Copy the colorkey values into a 2d array
pygame.surfarray.array_colorkey(Surface): return array

Create a new array with the colorkey transparency value from each
pixel. If the pixel matches the colorkey it will be fully tranparent;
otherwise it will be fully opaque.

This will work on any type of Surface format. If the image has no
colorkey a solid opaque array will be returned.

This function will temporarily lock the Surface as pixels are copied.
<END>

make_surface
Copy an array to a new surface
pygame.surfarray.make_surface(array): return Surface

Create a new Surface that best resembles the data and format on the
array. The array can be 2D or 3D with any sized integer values.
<END>

blit_array
Blit directly from a array values
pygame.surfarray.blit_array(Surface, array): return None

Directly copy values from an array into a Surface. This is faster than
converting the array into a Surface and blitting. The array must be the
same dimensions as the Surface and will completely replace all pixel
values. Only integer, ascii character and record arrays are accepted.

This function will temporarily lock the Surface as the new values are
copied.
<END>

map_array
Map a 3d array into a 2d array
pygame.surfarray.map_array(Surface, array3d): return array2d

Convert a 3D array into a 2D array. This will use the given Surface
format to control the conversion. Palette surface formats are supported
for numpy arrays.
<END>

use_arraytype
Sets the array system to be used for surface arrays
pygame.surfarray.use_arraytype (arraytype): return None

Uses the requested array type for the module functions.
Currently supported array types are:

  numeric 
  numpy

If the requested type is not available, a ValueError will be raised.

New in pygame 1.8.
<END>

get_arraytype
Gets the currently active array type.
pygame.surfarray.get_arraytype (): return str

Returns the currently active array type. This will be a value of the
get_arraytypes() tuple and indicates which type of array module is used
for the array creation.

New in pygame 1.8
<END>

get_arraytypes
Gets the array system types currently supported.
pygame.surfarray.get_arraytypes (): return tuple

Checks, which array systems are available and returns them as a tuple of
strings. The values of the tuple can be used directly in the
pygame.surfarray.use_arraytype () method. If no supported array system could
be found, None will be returned.

New in pygame 1.8.
