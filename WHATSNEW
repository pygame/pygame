    Fixed color.c for Symbian  Updated Symbian build instructions  Updated
      makeref.py with '--no-code-docs' feature to set empty module docstrings.
    Add <module>_tags.py modules to pygame.tests. This is an alternative
      module level __tags__ globals in the unit test <module>_test.py files
      themselves. The __tags__ global is placed in the corresponding
      <module>_tags.py file instead. This means test modules can be skipped
      by the pygame.tests.go test framework without actually loading the
      test module and running possibly problematic code. It also means
      the test framework can report on which test modules were skipped
      and why.

Apr 30, 2008
    updates to the sprite.py collision functions that update them to match 
        the modules coding style, include appropriate comments, and are 
        about 20% faster. It also includes a collide_circle_ratio function 
        for completeness, and perhaps most importantly, fixes a bug in 
        colide_mask which kept it from working correctly.  Also added unittests
        for the collision functions.  Thanks John Krukoff!

    [BUG] sound crackles on windows; restored chunk size

      Thanks Lorenz Quack!

Mar 5, 2008
    [BUG] Stopped releasing GIL on png, and jpeg saving functions because
        they do not seem to be thread safe.

    [BUG] A work around for 8 bit samples being stereo reversed with SDL_mixer.
        Also check the return value of Mix_SetPanning, and raise an 
        error on volume errors.

    [BUG] Changed default chunk size for pygame.mixer to 1024*3.  Which is 
        the magic number which stops scratchy sounds on most systems.  
        However it does make sounds a bit laggier... it's best provided as 
        a config item for users.

    Updated pygame.display.update() to release the GIL whilst doing things,
        so other threads can do things whilst it's updating the screen.

    Some comments to help Mac OSX people installing, and compiling pygame.
        About bdist_mpkg in setup, and also fixed an exception message 
        to be nicer about requiring pyobjc.

Mar 3, 2008
    [BUG] Fixed up pygame.mask.from_surface, got color key, and perpixel alpha 
        modes reversed.

    Also added better test to the mask test.  
        Also it wasn't testing pygame.mask.from_surface at all!

    Added pygame.sprite.collide_mask to join the mask_* collision functions.  
        Started adding test for pygame.sprite.spritecollide.


Feb 19, 2008

    rect for the surface, that contains visible (non-transparent) data.

Feb 14, 2008
    Updated constants GL_SWAP_CONTROL,GL_ACCELERATED_VISUAL,BUTTON_X1,BUTTON_X2

    Added pygame.key.get_repeat to see how holding keys down repeats.  This is
      the sister function of pygame.ket.set_repeat.

    MacOSX, and Windows binaries now use latest SDL 1.2.13

Feb 11, 2008
    An example of using pygame with no windowing system.  Useful for webserver
      scripts, or for little utilities.

    Updated mac_scrap to pass some tests, and raise NotImplementedError 
      otherwise.

    Further Windows build updates:
      For MinGW/MSYS the build process now finds the MSYS and MinGW
      directories automatically. gcc links to msvcr71.dll without
      requiring changes to the gcc specs file. This makes the build
      process GCC Version 4 ready. By default all DLLs are Win32 GUI,
      but can be console. The build progams will run from either the
      Windows or MSYS terminal.

      Fixed a bug where DLLs were not installed in the package directory.
      For Windows, everything now goes into the package directory.

      build_deps.py renamed to msys_build_deps.py to avoid confusion.

Jan 26, 2008
    pygame.sndarray noew can change between Numeric and numpy using the
      new methods pygame.sndarray.use_arraytype () and
      pygame.sndarray.get_arraytypes ().

Jan 24, 2008
    Updated the configuration and build process under Windows. In
       config_msys.py and config.py os.popen is replaced with the newer
       subprocess.Popen so the MSYS will run. Calls to raw_input now
       show the prompt on an MSYS console. In an MSYS build paths
       written to Setup are now Windows paths for distutils. The hard
       coded DLL file paths have been removed from setup.py.  It now
       gets the paths from Setup. Consequently, setup.py is now VC/MinGW
       agnostic.

    Added build_deps.py, an all-in-one dependency builder for
       Windows. Requires MinGW and MSYS.

Jan 8, 2008
    pygame.surfarray now can change between Numeric and numpy using the
       new methods pygame.surfarray.use_arraytype () and
       pygame.surfarray.get_arraytypes ().

Jan 4, 2008
    Removed Numeric compile time dependency.
    Added numpy surface array support.

Dec 31, 2007
    New method pygame.get_sdl_byteorder () to get the SDL byte order.

Dec 15, 2007
    Mask can now get bounding rects of set bits.
    pygame.transform can find edges in an image, get the average surface
      of many surfaces and also threshold an image by color.

Sep 1, 2007
    Added get_buffer() methods to Surface, and Sound - which return a new
     BufferProxy - which is a buffer interface only class.  Thanks Marcus!

Aug 23, 2007
    pygame.image.tostring changes from Brian Fisher. 
      RGBA_PREMULT & ARGB_PREMULT type to image.tostring (a very 
      nice thing for getting images into OpenGL)

Aug 22, 2007
    PixelArray from Marcus.  It's going to be a replacement for surfarray.
    [BUG] Fixed some bugs in Surface with SRCALPHA and input validation.
        Thanks Lenard Lindstrom and Brian Fisher.

Aug 15, 2007
    The sprite module has had some big changes from DR0ID.  It now has a 
     LayeredUpdates, and LayeredDirty groups.  For using layers when
     rendering the sprites.  LayeredDirty is an alternative to 
     RenderUpdates that automatically finds the best display method
     (either full screen updates, or dirty rect updates).  It's faster
     if you have sprites that don't move.  Thanks DR0ID!
    Added pygame.mask.from_surface which can make a Mask object from
     a surface.  It's 128x faster than the python version!
    pygame.movie bug fix. Thanks Lenard Lindstrom!

Jun 25, 2007
    Removed QNX support from scrap module. Thanks Marcus!
    Added smoothscale(with MMX!) function from Richard Goedeken

    Thanks Marcus, and thanks Campbell Barton for spotting them.

May 30, 2007
    Fixed some documentation.  mask, scrap, font modules.
    Fixed the mask.set_at get_at functions to raise a nice exception.
      Thanks piman!
    surface.fill() now takes the same BLEND_ADD BLEND_SUB etc flags that
      surface.blit() takes.  Which makes fade to white, and fade to black
      type operates simple and fast.  Thanks Marcus!!  
    Added the GL_SWAP_CONTROL constant from SDL.  Thanks Eyal Lotem!
    Added the new blitters from Marcus.  These speed up the blend functions
      and the alpha blit function.
    Added a -warnings flag to setup.py for extra warnings with gcc.
    A fix from Marcus for the scrap module in X11.

May 9, 2007
    Windows image copy/paste is working for scrap.
    Adding bitmask code from Ulf Ekström - for pixelperfect collision.

    A cursors.py example from Kamilche.  Thanks!

February 11, 2006
    Changed the behaviour of Clock.tick to use SDL_Delay instead of a busy 
      loop.  Added a tick_busy_loop which uses the old behaviour.  This 
      is more consistent with what people think Clock.tick() will do.
      That is, not use 100% cpu to get more accurate timing.
    testsprite.py example, which is based off the testsprite.c in SDL
      shows the performance of sprites, and is a good test.
    Added gp2x package which contains some constants for the gp2x buttons.
      This will be where gp2x specific functionality will live.
