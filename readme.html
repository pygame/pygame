<p><big><b><u>About</u></b></big><br><blockquote><p>
Pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write
multimedia software, such as games, in Python. Pygame requires the
Python language and SDL multimedia library. It can also make use of
several other popular libraries.
</p></blockquote></p><br>



<p><big><b><u>Installation</u></b></big><br><blockquote><p>
You should definitely begin by installing a binary package
for your system. The binary packages usually come with or
give the information needed for dependencies. Choose an
appropriate installer for your system and version of python
from the pygame downloads page.
<a href=http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml>http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml</a>
</p><p>
Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will involve
compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies. Once that is done
run the "<u>setup.py</u>" script which will attempt to auto-configure, build,
and install pygame.
<p></p>
Much more information about installing and compiling is available in the
<a href=install.html>install.html</a> file.
</p></blockquote></p><br>



<p><big><b><u>Help</u></b></big><br><blockquote><p>
If you are just getting started with pygame, you should be able
to get started fairly quickly. Pygame comes with many tutorials
and introductions. There is also full reference documentation for
the entire library. Browse the documentation from the documenantation
index. <a href=docs/index.html>docs/index.html</a>.
<p></p>
On the pygame website, there is also an online copy of this
documentation. You should know that the online documentation stays
up to date with the development version of pygame in svn. This may
be a bit newer than the version of pygame you are using.
<p></p>
Best of all the examples directory has many
playable small programs which can get started playing with the
code right away.

   Many thank you's for people making documentation comments, and adding to the
   pygame.org wiki.  
</p><p>
   Also many thanks for people creating games and putting them on the 
   pygame.org website for others to learn from and enjoy.

Also a big thanks to Roger Dingledine and the crew at SEUL.ORG
for our excellent hosting.

<p><big><b><u>Dependencies</u></b></big><br><blockquote><p>
Pygame is obviously strongly dependent on SDL and Python. It also
links to and embeds several other smaller libraries. The font module
relies on SDL_tff, which is dependent on freetype. The mixer (and
mixer.music) modules depend on SDL_mixer. The image module depends
on SDL_image, which also can use libjpeg and libpng. The transform
module has an embedded version of SDL_rotozoom for its own rotozoom
function. The surfarray module requires the python Numeric package
for its multidimensional numeric arrays.
</p></blockquote></p><br>



<p><big><b><u>Todo / Ideas</u></b></big> (feel free to submit)<br><ul>
<li>transform.skew() function</li>
<li>transform.scroll() function</li>
<li>image filtering (colors,blurs,etc)</li>
<li>quake-like console with python interpreter</li>
<li>game lobby. client, simple server, and protocol</li>
<li>surfarrays should be able to do RGBA along with RGB</li>
<li>draw with transparancy</li>
<li>draw large sets of primitives with a single call</li>
<li>drawing offsets, perhaps as subsurfaces</li>
<li>new scale2x, scale3x, and scale4x from hiend3d</li>
<li>switch Numeric to numarray (see docs on how to do both)</li>
<li>audio resampling</li>
</ul></p><br>

This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want, but
if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, those must be
released with a compatible license. (preferably submitted back to the
pygame project). Closed source and commercial games are fine.
