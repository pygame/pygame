pygame
the top level pygame package

The pygame package represents the top-level package for others to use. Pygame
itself is broken into many submodules, but this does not affect programs that
use Pygame.

As a convenience, most of the top-level variables in pygame have been placed
inside a module named 'pygame.locals'. This is meant to be used with
'from pygame.locals import *', in addition to 'import pygame'.

When you 'import pygame' all available pygame submodules are automatically
imported. Be aware that some of the pygame modules are considered "optional",
and may not be available. In that case, Pygame will provide a placeholder object
instead of the module, which can be used to test for availability.
<SECTION>



init
initialize all imported pygame modules
pygame.init(): return (numpass, numfail)

Initialize all imported Pygame modules. No exceptions will be raised if a
module fails, but the total number if successful and failed inits will be
returned as a tuple. You can always initialize individual modules manually,
but pygame.init is a convenient way to get everything started. The init()
functions for individual modules will raise exceptions when they fail.

You may want to initalise the different modules seperately to speed up 
your program or to not use things your game does not.

It is safe to call this init() more than once: repeated calls will have no effect.
This is true even if you have pygame.quit() all the modules.
<END>



quit
uninitialize all pygame modules
pygame.quit(): return None

Uninitialize all pygame modules that have previously been initialized. When
the Python interpreter shuts down, this method is called regardless, so your
program should not need it, except when it wants to terminate its pygame
resources and continue. It is safe to call this function more than once:
repeated calls have no effect. 

Note, that pygame.quit will not exit your program.  Consider letting your 
program end in the same way a normal python program will end.
<END>



error
standard pygame exception
raise pygame.error, message

This exception is raised whenever a pygame or SDL operation fails. You can
catch any anticipated problems and deal with the error. The exception is
always raised with a descriptive message about the problem.

Derived from the RuntimeError exception, which can also be used to catch these
raised errors.
<END>



get_error
get the current error message
pygame.get_error(): return errorstr

SDL maintains an internal error message. This message will usually be given to
you when pygame.error is raised. You will rarely need to call this function.
<END>



set_error
set the current error message
pygame.set_error(error_msg): return None

SDL maintains an internal error message. This message will usually be given to
you when pygame.error is raised. You will rarely need to call this function.
<END>



get_sdl_version
get the version number of SDL
pygame.get_sdl_version(): return major, minor, patch

Returns the three version numbers of the SDL library. This version is
built at compile time. It can be used to detect which features may not
be available through Pygame.

get_sdl_version is new in pygame 1.7.0
<END>


get_sdl_byteorder
get the byte order of SDL
pygame.get_sdl_byteorder(): return int

Returns the byte order of the SDL library. It returns LIL_ENDIAN for
little endian byte order and BIG_ENDIAN for big endian byte order.

get_sdl_byteorder is new in pygame 1.8
<END>


register_quit
register a function to be called when pygame quits
register_quit(callable): return None

When pygame.quit is called, all registered quit functions are called. Pygame
modules do this automatically when they are initializing. This function is
not be needed for regular pygame users. 
<END>


encode_string
Encode a unicode or bytes object
encode_string([obj [, encoding [, errors [, etype]]]]) => bytes or None

obj: If unicode, encode; if bytes, return unaltered; if anything else,
  return None; if not given, raise SyntaxError.
  encoding (string): If present, encoding to use. The default is
  'unicode_escape'.
errors (string): If given, how to handle unencodable characters.
  The default is 'backslashreplace'.
etype (exception type): If given, the exception type to raise for
  an encoding error. The default is UnicodeEncodeError, as returned
  by PyUnicode_AsEncodedString(). For the default encoding and
  errors values there should be no encoding errors.

This function is used in encoding file paths. Keyword arguments are supported.

Added in Pygame 1.9.2 (primarily for use in unit tests)
<END>


encode_file_path
Encode a unicode or bytes object as a file system path
encode_file_path([obj [, etype]]) => bytes or None

obj: If unicode, encode; if bytes, return unaltered; if anything else,
  return None; if not given, raise SyntaxError.
etype (exception type): If given, the exception type to raise for
  an encoding error. The default is UnicodeEncodeError, as returned
  by PyUnicode_AsEncodedString().

This function is used to encode file paths in Pygame.
Encoding is to the codec as returned by sys.getfilesystemencoding().
Keyword arguments are supported.

Added in Pygame 1.9.2 (primarily for use in unit tests) 
<END>


version
small module containing version information
module pygame.version

This module is automatically imported into the pygame package and offers a
few variables to check with version of pygame has been imported.
<SECTION>



ver
version number as a string
pygame.version.ver = '1.2'

This is the version represented as a string. It can contain a micro release
number as well, e.g., '1.5.2'
<END>



vernum
tupled integers of the version
pygame.version.vernum = (1, 5, 3)

This variable for the version can easily be compared with other version
numbers of the same format. An example of checking Pygame version numbers
would look like this:

    if pygame.version.vernum < (1, 5):
        print 'Warning, older version of Pygame (%s)' %  pygame.version.ver
        disable_advanced_features = True
        
<END>
<END>
<END>
