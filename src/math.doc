pygame.math
pygame module for vector classes

!!!EXPERIMENTAL!!!
Note: This Modul is still in development and the API might change. 
Please report bug and suggestions to pygame-users@seul.org

The pygame math module currently provides Vector classes in two 
and three dimensions, Vector2 and Vector3 respectively.

They support the following numerical operations:
vec+vec, vec-vec, vec*number, number*vec, vec/number, vec//number, 
vec+=vec, vec-=vec, vec*=number, vec/=number, vec//=number. All 
these operations will be performed elementwise.
In addition vec*vec will perform a scalar-product (a.k.a. 
dot-product).
If you want to multiply every element from vector v with every
element from vector w you can use the elementwise method:
v.elementwise() * w

called. By default swizzling is disabled.
