pygame.font
pygame module for loading and rendering fonts

The font module allows for rendering TrueType fonts into a new Surface object.
It accepts any UCS-2 character ('\u0001' to '\uFFFF').
This module is optional and requires SDL_ttf as a dependency.
You should test that pygame.font is available and initialized before attempting
to use the module.
 
Most of the work done with fonts are done by using the actual Font objects.
The module by itself only has routines to initialize the module and create
Font objects with pygame.font.Font().
 
You can load fonts from the system by using the pygame.font.SysFont()
function. There are a few other functions to help lookup the system fonts.

Pygame comes with a builtin default font. This can always be accessed by
passing None as the font name.
<SECTION>



init
initialize the font module
pygame.font.init(): return None

This method is called automatically by pygame.init().
It initializes the font module. The module must be initialized before any
other functions will work.

It is safe to call this function more than once.
<END>



quit
uninitialize the font module
pygame.font.quit(): return None

Manually uninitialize SDL_ttf's font system. This is called
automatically by pygame.quit().

It is safe to call this function even if font is currently
not initialized.
<END>



get_init
true if the font module is initialized
pygame.font.get_init(): return bool

Test if the font module is initialized or not.
<END>



get_default_font
get the filename of the default font
pygame.font.get_default_font(): return string

Return the filename of the system font. This is not the full path to the file.
This file can usually be found in the same directory as the font module, but
it can also be bundled in separate archives.
<END>



get_fonts
get all available fonts
pygame.font.get_fonts(): return list of strings

Returns a list of all the fonts available on the system. The names of the 
fonts will be set to lowercase with all spaces and punctuation removed. 
This works on most systems, but some will return an empty list if they cannot 
find fonts.
<END>



match_font
find a specific font on the system
pygame.font.match_font(name, bold=False, italic=False): return path

Returns the full path to a font file on the system. If bold or italic are
set to true, this will attempt to find the correct family of font.

The font name can actually be a comma separated list of font names to try.
If none of the given names are found, None is returned.

Example:

    print pygame.font.match_font('bitstreamverasans')
    # output is: /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/Vera.ttf
    # (but only if you have Vera on your system)
<END>




SysFont
create a Font object from the system fonts
pygame.font.SysFont(name, size, bold=False, italic=False): return Font

Return a new Font object that is loaded from the system fonts. The font will
match the requested bold and italic flags. If a suitable system font is not
found this will fallback on loading the default pygame font. The font name
can be a comma separated list of font names to look for.
<END>



Font
create a new Font object from a file
pygame.font.Font(filename, size): return Font
pygame.font.Font(object, size): return Font

Load a new font from a given filename or a python file object. The size 
is the height of the font in pixels. If the filename is None the Pygame
default font will be loaded. If a font cannot be loaded from the arguments
given an exception will be raised. Once the font is created the size cannot
be changed. 

Font objects are mainly used to render text into new Surface objects. The
render can emulate bold or italic features, but it is better to load from
a font with actual italic or bold glyphs. The rendered text can be regular
strings or unicode.
<SECTION>



render
draw text on a new Surface
Font.render(text, antialias, color, background=None): return Surface

This creates a new Surface with the specified text rendered on it.
Pygame provides no way to directly draw text on an existing Surface:
instead you must use Font.render() to create an image (Surface) of
the text, then blit this image onto another Surface.

The text can only be a single line: newline characters are not rendered.
Null characters ('\x00') raise a TypeError.
Both Unicode and char (byte) strings are accepted.
For Unicode strings only UCS-2 characters ('\u0001' to '\uFFFF') are recognized.
Anything greater raises a UnicodeError.
For char strings a LATIN1 encoding is assumed.
The antialias argument is a boolean: if true the characters will have
smooth edges. The color argument is the color of the text
[e.g.: (0,0,255) for blue]. The optional
background argument is a color to use for the text background. If no
background is passed the area outside the text will be transparent.

The Surface returned will be of the dimensions required to hold the text.
(the same as those returned by Font.size()).
If an empty string is passed for the text, a blank surface will be returned
that is one pixel wide and the height of the font.

Depending on the type of background and antialiasing used, this returns
different types of Surfaces. For performance reasons, it is good to know what
type of image will be used. If antialiasing is not used, the return image will
always be an 8bit image with a two color palette. If the background is
transparent a colorkey will be set. Antialiased images are rendered to 24-bit
RGB images. If the background is transparent a pixel alpha will be included.

Optimization: if you know that the final destination for the text (on the screen)
will always have a solid background, and the text is antialiased, you can
improve performance by specifying the background color. This will cause
the resulting image to maintain transparency information by colorkey
rather than (much less efficient) alpha values.

If you render '\n' a unknown char will be rendered.  Usually a rectangle.
Instead you need to handle new lines yourself.

Font rendering is not thread safe: only a single thread can render text at
any time.
<END>



size
determine the amount of space needed to render text
Font.size(text): return (width, height)

Returns the dimensions needed to render the text. This can be used to
help determine the positioning needed for text before it is rendered.
It can also be used for wordwrapping and other layout effects.

Be aware that most fonts use kerning which adjusts the widths for specific
letter pairs. For example, the width for "ae" will not always match the width for "a" + "e".
<END>



set_underline
control if text is rendered with an underline
Font.set_underline(bool): return None

When enabled, all rendered fonts will include an underline. The underline is
always one pixel thick, regardless of font size. This can be mixed with
the bold and italic modes.
<END>



get_underline
check if text will be rendered with an underline
Font.get_underline(): return bool

Return True when the font underline is enabled.
<END>



set_bold
enable fake rendering of bold text
Font.set_bold(bool): return None

Enables the bold rendering of text. This is a fake stretching of the font
that doesn't look good on many font types. If possible load the font from
a real bold font file. While bold, the font will have a different width
than when normal. This can be mixed with the italic and underline modes.
<END>



get_bold
check if text will be rendered bold
Font.get_bold(): return bool

Return True when the font bold rendering mode is enabled.
<END>



set_italic
enable fake rendering of italic text
Font.set_bold(bool): return None

Enables fake rendering of italic text. This is a fake skewing of the
font that doesn't look good on many font types. If possible load the font from
a real italic font file. While italic the font will have a different width
than when normal. This can be mixed with the bold and underline modes.
<END>


metrics
Gets the metrics for each character in the pased string.
Font.metrics(text): return list

The list contains tuples for each character, which contain the minimum
X offset, the maximum X offset, the minimum Y offset, the maximum
Y offset and the advance offset (bearing plus width) of the character.
[(minx, maxx, miny, maxy, advance), (minx, maxx, miny, maxy, advance), ...].
None is entered in the list for each unrecognized character.
<END>


get_italic
check if the text will be rendered italic
Font.get_italic(): return bool

Return True when the font italic rendering mode is enabled.
<END>



get_linesize
get the line space of the font text
Font.get_linesize(): return int

Return the height in pixels for a line of text with the font. When rendering
multiple lines of text this is the recommended amount of space between lines.
<END>



get_height
get the height of the font
Font.get_height(): return int

Return the height in pixels of the actual rendered text. This is the average
size for each glyph in the font.
<END>



get_ascent
get the ascent of the font
Font.get_ascent(): return int

Return the height in pixels for the font ascent. The ascent is the number
of pixels from the font baseline to the top of the font.
<END>



get_descent
get the descent of the font
Font.get_descent(): return int

Return the height in pixels for the font descent. The descent is the number
of pixels from the font baseline to the bottom of the font.
<END>
<END>
<END>
