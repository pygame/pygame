pygame.scrap
pygame module for clipboard support.


EXPERIMENTAL!: meaning this api may change, or dissapear in later 
pygame releases.  If you use this, your code will break with the 
next pygame release.


The scrap module is for getting and putting stuff from the clipboard.
So you can copy and paste things between pygame, and other application
types. It defines some basic own data types 

  SCRAP_PPM
  SCRAP_PBM
  SCRAP_BMP
  SCRAP_TEXT

to be placed into the clipboard and allows to use define own clipboard
types. SCRAP_PPM, SCRAP_PBM and SCRAP_BMP are suitable for surface
buffers to be shared with other applications, while SCRAP_TEXT is an
alias for the plain text clipboard type.

The SCRAP_* types refer to the following MIME types and register those
as well as the default operating system type for this type of data:

  SCRAP_TEXT text/plain    for plain text
  SCRAP_PBM  image/pbm     for PBM encoded image data
  SCRAP_PPM  image/ppm     for PPM encoded image data
  SCRAP_BMP  image/bmp     for BMP encoded image data

Depending on the platform additional types are automatically registered
when data is placed into the clipboard to guarantee a consistent sharing
behaviour with other applications. The following listed types can be
used as string to be passed to the respective pygame.scrap module
functions.

For Windows platforms, the additional types are supported automatically
and resolve to their internal definitions:
  text/plain;charset=utf-8 for UTF-8 encoded text
  audio/wav                for WAV encoded audio
  image/tiff               for TIFF encoded image data

For X11 platforms, the additional types are supported automatically
and resolve to their internal definitions:
  UTF8_STRING               for UTF-8 encoded text
  text/plain;charset=utf-8  for UTF-8 encoded text
  COMPOUND_TEXT             for COMPOUND text

As stated before you can define own types for the clipboard, those
however might not be usable by other applications. Thus data pasted into
the clipboard using

  pygame.scrap.put ("own_data", data)

can only be used by applications, which query the clipboard for the
"own_data" type.


New in pygame 1.8. Only works for Windows, X11 and Mac OS X so far.  On
Mac OSX only text works at the moment - other types will be supported in
the next release.
<SECTION>

init
Initializes the scrap module.
scrap.init () -> None

Tries to initialize the scrap module and raises an exception, if it
fails. Note that this module requires a set display surface, so you have
to make sure, you acquired one earlier using pygame.display.set_mode().
<END>

get
Gets the data for the specified type from the clipboard.
scrap.get (type) -> string

Returns the data for the specified type from the clipboard.
The data is returned as string and might need further processing.
If no data for the passed type is available, None is returned.

  text = pygame.scrap.get (SCRAP_TEXT)
  if text:
      # Do stuff with it.
  else:
      print "There does not seem to be text in the clipboard."
<END>

get_types
Gets a list of the available clipboard types.
scrap.get_types () -> list

Gets a list of strings with the identifiers for the available
clipboard types. Each identifier can be used in the scrap.get()
method to get the clipboard content of the specific type.
If there is no data in the clipboard, an empty list is returned.

  types = pygame.scrap.get_types ()
  for t in types:
      if "text" in t:
          # There is some content with the word "text" in it. It's
          # possibly text, so print it.
          print pygame.scrap.get (t)
<END>

put
Places data into the clipboard.
scrap.put(type, data) -> None

Places data for a specific clipboard type into the clipboard.
The data must be a string buffer. The type is a string identifying
the type of data placed into the clipboard. This can be one of the
native SCRAP_PBM, SCRAP_PPM, SCRAP_BMP or SCRAP_TEXT values or an own
string identifier.

The method raises an exception, if the content could not be placed
into the clipboard.

  fp = open ("example.bmp", "rb")
  pygame.scrap.put (SCRAP_BMP, fp.read ())
  fp.close ()
  # Now you can acquire the image data from the clipboard in other
  # applications.
  
  pygame.scrap.put (SCRAP_TEXT, "A text to copy")
  pygame.scrap.put ("Plain text", "A text to copy")
<END>

contains
Checks, whether a certain type is available in the clipboard.
scrap.contains (type) -> bool

Returns True, if data for the passed type is available in the
clipboard, False otherwise.

  if pygame.scrap.contains (SCRAP_TEXT):
      print "There is text in the clipboard."
  if pygame.scrap.contains ("own_data_type"):
      print "There is stuff in the clipboard."
<END>

lost
Checks whether the clipboard is currently owned by the application.
scrap.lost() -> bool

Returns True, if the clipboard is currently owned by the pygame
application, False otherwise.

  if pygame.scrap.lost ():
     print "No content from me anymore. The clipboard is used by someone else."
<END>

set_mode
Sets the clipboard access mode.
scrap.set_mode(mode) -> None

Sets the access mode for the clipboard. This is only of interest for X11
environments, where clipboard modes for mouse selections
(SRAP_SELECTION) and the clipboard (SCRAP_CLIPBOARD) are
available. Setting the mode to SCRAP_SELECTION in other environments
will not cause any difference.

If a value different from SCRAP_CLIPBOARD or SCRAP_SELECTION is passed,
a ValueError will be raised.
