pygame.image
pygame module for image transfer

The image module contains functions for loading and saving pictures, as
well as transferring Surfaces to formats usable by other packages.

Note that there is no Image class; an image is loaded as a
Surface object. The Surface class allows manipulation (drawing lines,
setting pixels, capturing regions, etc.).

The image module is a required
dependency of Pygame, but it only optionally supports any extended file formats.
By default it can only load uncompressed BMP images. When built with full image
support, the pygame.image.load() function can support the following formats.

* JPG
* PNG
* GIF (non animated)
* BMP
* PCX
* TGA (uncompressed)
* TIF
* LBM (and PBM)
* PBM (and PGM, PPM)
* XPM

Saving images only supports a limited set of formats. You can save
to the following formats.

* BMP
* TGA
* PNG
* JPEG

load
load new image from a file
pygame.image.load(filename): return Surface
pygame.image.load(fileobj, namehint=""): return Surface

Load an image from a file source. You can pass either a filename or a Python
file-like object.

Pygame will automatically determine the image type (e.g., GIF or bitmap)
and create a new Surface object from the data. In some cases it will need to
know the file extension (e.g., GIF images should end in ".gif").
If you pass a raw file-like object, you may also want to pass the original
filename as the namehint argument.

The returned Surface will contain the same color format, colorkey and alpha
transparency as the file it came from. You will often want to call
Surface.convert() with no arguments, to create a copy that will draw more
quickly on the screen.

For alpha transparency, like in .png images use the convert_alpha() method 
after loading so that the image has per pixel transparency.

Pygame may not always be built to support all image formats. At minimum it will
support uncompressed BMP. If pygame.image.get_extended() returns 'True', you
should be able to load most images (including png, jpg and gif).

You should use os.path.join() for compatibility.  
  eg. asurf = pygame.image.load(os.path.join('data', 'bla.png'))
<END>


save
save an image to disk
pygame.image.save(Surface, filename): return None

This will save your Surface as either a BMP, TGA, PNG, or JPEG image. If the 
filename extension is unrecognized it will default to TGA. Both TGA, and BMP 
file formats create uncompressed files.

get_extended
test if extended image formats can be loaded
pygame.image.get_extended(): return bool

If pygame is built with extended image formats this function will return True.
It is still not possible to determine which formats will be available, but
generally you will be able to load them all.
<END>



tostring
transfer image to string buffer
pygame.image.tostring(Surface, format, flipped=False): return string

Creates a string that can be transferred with the 'fromstring' method in
other Python imaging packages. Some Python image packages prefer their images
in bottom-to-top format (PyOpenGL for example). If you pass True for the
flipped argument, the string buffer will be vertically flipped.

The format argument is a string of one of the following values. Note that only
8bit Surfaces can use the "P" format. The other formats will work for any
Surface. Also note that other Python image packages support more formats than
Pygame.

* P, 8bit palettized Surfaces
* RGB, 24bit image 
* RGBX, 32bit image with unused space
* RGBA, 32bit image with an alpha channel
* ARGB, 32bit image with alpha channel first
* RGBA_PREMULT, 32bit image with colors scaled by alpha channel
* ARGB_PREMULT, 32bit image with colors scaled by alpha channel, alpha channel first
<END>



fromstring
create new Surface from a string buffer
pygame.image.fromstring(string, size, format, flipped=False): return Surface

This function takes arguments similar to pygame.image.tostring(). The size
argument is a pair of numbers representing the width and height. Once the
new Surface is created you can destroy the string buffer.

The size and format image must compute the exact same size as the passed
string buffer. Otherwise an exception will be raised. 

See the pygame.image.frombuffer() method for a potentially faster way to
transfer images into Pygame.
<END>


frombuffer
create a new Surface that shares data inside a string buffer
pygame.image.frombuffer(string, size, format): return Surface

Create a new Surface that shares pixel data directly from the string buffer.
This method takes the same arguments as pygame.image.fromstring(), but is
unable to vertically flip the source data.

This will run much faster than pygame.image.fromstring, since no pixel data
must be allocated and copied.
