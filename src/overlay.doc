pygame.Overlay
pygame object for video overlay graphics
pygame.Overlay(format, (width, height)): return Overlay

The Overlay objects provide support for accessing hardware video overlays.
Video overlays do not use standard RGB pixel formats, and can use multiple
resolutions of data to create a single image.

The Overlay objects represent lower level access to the display hardware.
To use the object you must understand the technical details of video overlays.

The Overlay format determines the type of pixel data used. Not all hardware
will support all types of overlay formats. Here is a list of available
format types:

  YV12_OVERLAY, IYUV_OVERLAY, YUV2_OVERLAY, UYVY_OVERLAY, YVYU_OVERLAY

The width and height arguments control the size for the overlay image data.
The overlay image can be displayed at any size, not just the resolution of
the overlay.

The overlay objects are always visible, and always show above the regular
display contents.
<SECTION>



display
set the overlay pixel data
Overlay.display((y, u, v)): return None
Overlay.display(): return None

Display the yuv data in SDL's overlay planes. The y, u, and v
arguments are strings of binary data. The data must be in the correct
format used to create the Overlay.

If no argument is passed in, the Overlay will simply be redrawn with the
current data. This can be useful when the Overlay is not really hardware
accelerated.

The strings are not validated, and improperly sized strings could crash the
program.
<END>



set_location
control where the overlay is displayed
Overlay.set_location(rect): return None

Set the location for the overlay. The overlay will always be shown relative
to the main display Surface. This does not actually redraw the overlay, it
will be updated on the next call to Overlay.display().
<END>



get_hardware
test if the Overlay is hardware accelerated
Overlay.get_hardware(rect): return int

Returns a True value when the Overlay is hardware accelerated. If the platform
does not support acceleration, software rendering is used.
