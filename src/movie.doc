pygame.movie
pygame module for playback of mpeg video

NOTE: pygame.movie currently does not work on windows with the latest pygame release.  
As no one has managed to get smpeg working there.  The alternative is to use 
<a href="http://www.pymedia.org/">pymedia</a>

Pygame can playback video and audio from basic encoded MPEG1 video files.
Movie playback happens in background threads, which makes playback easy to
manage.

The audio for Movies must have full control over the sound system. This means
the pygame.mixer module must be uninitialized if the movie's sound is to be played.
The common solution is to call pygame.mixer.quit() before the movie begins. The
mixer can be reinitialized after the movie is finished.

The video overlay planes are drawn on top of everything in the display window.
To draw the movie as normal graphics into the display window, create an
offscreen Surface and set that as the movie target. Then once per frame blit
that surface to the screen.

Movie
load an mpeg movie file
pygame.movie.Movie(filename): return Movie
pygame.movie.Movie(object): return Movie

Load a new MPEG movie stream from a file or a python file object. The Movie
object operates similar to the Sound objects from pygame.mixer.

Movie objects have a target display Surface. The movie is rendered into this
Surface in a background thread. If the target Surface is the display Surface,
the movie will try to use the hardware accelerated video overlay. The default
target is the display Surface.
<SECTION>


play
start playback of a movie
Movie.play(loops=0): return None

Starts playback of the movie. Sound and video will begin playing if they
are not disabled. The optional loops argument controls how many times
the movie will be repeated. A loop value of -1 means the movie will repeat
forever.
<END>



stop
stop movie playback
Movie.stop(): return None

Stops the playback of a movie. The video and audio playback will be stopped
at their current position.
<END>


pause
temporarily stop and resume playback
Movie.pause(): return None

This will temporarily stop or restart movie playback.
<END>



skip
advance the movie playback position
Movie.skip(seconds): return None

Advance the movie playback time in seconds. This can be called before the
movie is played to set the starting playback time. This can only skip the
movie forward, not backwards. The argument is a floating point number.
<END>



rewind
restart the movie playback
Movie.rewind(): return None

Sets the movie playback position to the start of the movie. The movie will
automatically begin playing even if it stopped.

The can raise a ValueError if the movie cannot be rewound. If the rewind fails
the movie object is considered invalid.
<END>



render_frame
set the current video frame
Movie.render_frame(frame_number): return frame_number

This takes an integer frame number to render. It attempts to render the
given frame from the movie to the target Surface. It returns the real
frame number that got rendered.
<END>



get_frame
get the current video frame
Movie.get_frame(): return frame_number

Returns the integer frame number of the current video frame.
<END>



get_time
get the current vide playback time
Movie.get_time(): return seconds

Return the current playback time as a floating point value in seconds.
This method currently seems broken and always returns 0.0.
<END>



get_busy
check if the movie is currently playing
Movie.get_busy(): return bool

Returns true if the movie is currently being played.
<END>



get_length
the total length of the movie in seconds
Movie.get_length(): return seconds

Returns the length of the movie in seconds as a floating point value.
<END>



get_size
get the resolution of the video
Movie.get_size(): return (width, height)

Gets the resolution of the movie video. The movie will be stretched to
the size of any Surface, but this will report the natural video size.
<END>



has_video
check if the movie file contains video
Movie.get_video(): return bool

True when the opened movie file contains a video stream.
<END>



has_audio
check if the movie file contains audio
Movie.get_audio(): return bool

True when the opened movie file contains an audio stream.
<END>



set_volume
set the audio playback volume
Movie.set_volume(value): return None

Set the playback volume for this movie. The argument is a value between
0.0 and 1.0. If the volume is set to 0 the movie audio will not be decoded.
<END>



set_display
set the video target Surface
Movie.set_display(Surface, rect=None): return None

Set the output target Surface for the movie video. You may also pass a rectangle
argument for the position, which will move and stretch the video into the
given area.

If None is passed as the target Surface, the video decoding will be disabled.
<END>
<END>
<END>
