pygame.joystick
pygame module for interacting with joystick devices

The joystick module manages the joystick devices on a computer
(there can be more than one). Joystick devices include
trackballs and video-game-style gamepads, and the module allows
the use of multiple buttons and "hats".
<SECTION>


init
initialize the joystick module
pygame.joystick.init(): return None

This function is called automatically by pygame.init().

It initializes the joystick module. This will scan the system for all joystick
devices. The module must be initialized before any other functions will work.

It is safe to call this function more than once.
<END>



quit
uninitialize the joystick module
pygame.joystick.quit(): return None

Uninitialize the joystick module. After you call this any existing joystick
objects will no longer work.

It is safe to call this function more than once.
<END>



get_init
true if the joystick module is initialized
pygame.joystick.get_init(): return bool

Test if the pygame.joystick.init() function has been called.
<END>



get_count
number of joysticks on the system
pygame.joystick.get_count(): return count

Return the number of joystick devices on the system. The
count will be 0 if there are no joysticks on the system.

When you create Joystick objects using Joystick(id), you pass an integer that
must be lower than this count.
<END>



Joystick
create a new Joystick object
pygame.joystick.Joystick(id): return Joystick

Create a new joystick to access a physical device. The id argument must
be a value from 0 to pygame.joystick.get_count()-1.

To access most of the Joystick methods, you'll need to init() 
the Joystick. This is separate from making sure the joystick module is
initialized. When multiple Joysticks objects are created for the
same physical joystick device (i.e., they have the same ID number),
the state and values for those Joystick objects
will be shared.

The Joystick object allows you to get information about the types of
controls on a joystick device. Once the device is initialized the Pygame
event queue will start receiving events about its input.
 
You can call the Joystick.get_name() and Joystick.get_id() functions
without initializing the Joystick object.
<SECTION>



init
initialize the Joystick
Joystick.init(): return None

The Joystick must be initialized to get most of the information about
the controls. While the Joystick is initialized the Pygame event queue will
receive events from the Joystick input.

It is safe to call this more than once.
<END>



quit
uninitialize the Joystick
Joystick.quit(): return None

This will unitialize a Joystick. After this the Pygame event queue will
no longer receive events from the device.

It is safe to call this more than once.
<END>



get_init
check if the Joystick is initialized
Joystick.get_init(): return bool

Returns True if the init() method has already been called
on this Joystick object.
<END>



get_id
get the Joystick ID
Joystick.get_id(): return int

Returns the integer ID that represents this device. This is the same value
that was passed to the Joystick() constructor. This method can safely
be called while the Joystick is not initialized.
<END>


get_name
get the Joystick system name
Joystick.get_name(): return string

Returns the system name for this joystick device. It is unknown what name
the system will give to the Joystick, but it should be a unique name that
identifies the device. This method can safely be called while the Joystick
is not initialized.
<END>



get_numaxes
get the number of axes on a Joystick
Joystick.get_numaxes(): return int

Returns the number of input axes are on a Joystick. There will usually be
two for the position. Controls like rudders and throttles are treated as
additional axes.

The pygame.JOYAXISMOTION events will be in the range from -1.0 to 1.0. A value
of 0.0 means the axis is centered. Gamepad devices will usually be -1, 0, or 1
with no values in between. Older analog joystick axes will not always use the
full -1 to 1 range, and the centered value will be some area around 0. 
Analog joysticks usually have a bit of noise in their axis, which will generate
a lot of rapid small motion events.
<END>



get_axis
get the current position of an axis
Joystick.get_axis(axis_number): return float

Returns the current position of a joystick axis. The value will range from
-1 to 1 with a value of 0 being centered. You may want to take into account
some tolerance to handle jitter, and joystick drift may keep the joystick
from centering at 0 or using the full range of position values.

The axis number must be an integer from zero to get_numaxes()-1.
<END>



get_numballs
get the number of trackballs on a Joystick
Joystick.get_numballs(): return int

Returns the number of trackball devices on a Joystick. These devices work
similar to a mouse but they have no absolute position; they only have relative
amounts of movement.

The pygame.JOYBALLMOTION event will be sent when the trackball is rolled.
It will report the amount of movement on the trackball.
<END>



get_ball
get the relative position of a trackball
Joystick.get_ball(ball_number): return x, y

Returns the relative movement of a joystick button. The value is a x, y pair
holding the relative movement since the last call to get_ball.

The ball number must be an integer from zero to get_numballs()-1.
<END>



get_numbuttons
get the number of buttons on a Joystick
Joystick.get_numbuttons(): return int

Returns the number of pushable buttons on the joystick. These buttons have
a boolean (on or off) state.

Buttons generate a pygame.JOYBUTTONDOWN and pygame.JOYBUTTONUP event when
they are pressed and released.
<END>



get_button
get the current button state
Joystick.get_button(button): return bool

Returns the current state of a joystick button.
<END>



get_numhats
get the number of hat controls on a Joystick
Joystick.get_numhats(): return int

Returns the number of joystick hats on a Joystick. Hat devices are like
miniature digital joysticks on a joystick. Each hat has two axes of input.

The pygame.JOYHATMOTION event is generated when the hat changes position.
The position attribute for the event contains a pair of values that are
either -1, 0, or 1. A position of (0, 0) means the hat is centered.
<END>


get_hat
get the position of a joystick hat
Joystick.get_hat(hat_number): return x, y

Returns the current position of a position hat. The position is given as two
values representing the X and Y position for the hat. (0, 0) means centered.
A value of -1 means left/down and a value of 1 means right/up: so (-1, 0)
means left; (1, 0) means right; (0, 1) means up; (1, 1) means upper-right; etc.

This value is digital, i.e., each coordinate can be -1, 0 or 1 but never
in-between.

The hat number must be between 0 and get_numhats()-1.
<END>
<END>
