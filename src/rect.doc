pygame.Rect
pygame object for storing rectangular coordinates
pygame.Rect(left, top, width, height): return Rect
pygame.Rect((left, top), (width, height)): return Rect
pygame.Rect(object): return Rect

Pygame uses Rect objects to store and manipulate rectangular areas. A Rect
can be created from a combination of left, top, width, and height values.
Rects can also be created from python objects that are already a Rect or
have an attribute named "rect".

Any Pygame function that requires a Rect argument also accepts any of
these values to construct a Rect. This makes it easier to create Rects
on the fly as arguments to functions.

The Rect functions that change the position or size of a Rect return
a new copy of the Rect with the affected changes. The original Rect
is not modified. Some methods have an alternate "in-place" version that
returns None but effects the original Rect. These "in-place" methods
are denoted with the "ip" suffix.

The Rect object has several virtual attributes which can be used to move
and align the Rect:

    top, left, bottom, right
    topleft, bottomleft, topright, bottomright
    midtop, midleft, midbottom, midright
    center, centerx, centery
    size, width, height
    w,h

All of these attributes can be assigned to:

    rect1.right = 10
    rect2.center = (20,30)

Assigning to size, width or height changes the dimensions of the
rectangle; all other assignments move the rectangle without
resizing it. Notice that some attributes are integers and
others are pairs of integers.

If a Rect has a nonzero width or height, it will return True for a
nonzero test. Some methods return a Rect with 0 size to represent an
invalid rectangle.

The coordinates for Rect objects are all integers. The size values
can be programmed to have negative values, but these are considered
illegal Rects for most operations.

There are several collision tests between other rectangles. Most
python containers can be searched for collisions against a single Rect.

The area covered by a Rect does not include the right- and bottom-most
edge of pixels. If one Rect's bottom border is another Rect's top border
(i.e., rect1.bottom=rect2.top), the two meet exactly on the screen
but do not overlap, and rect1.colliderect(rect2) returns false.

Though Rect can be subclassed, methods that return new rectangles are not
subclass aware. That is, move or copy return a new pygame.Rect instance,
not an instance of the subclass. This may change. To make subclass awareness
work though, subclasses may have to maintain the same constructor signature
as Rect.
<SECTION>


copy
copy the rectangle
Rect.copy(): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle having the same position and size as the orginal.

New in pygame 1.9
<END>


move
moves the rectangle
Rect.move(x, y): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is moved by the given offset. The x and y
arguments can be any integer value, positive or negative.
<END>



move_ip
moves the rectangle, in place
Rect.move_ip(x, y): return None

Same as the Rect.move() method, but operates in place.
<END>


inflate
grow or shrink the rectangle size
Rect.inflate(x, y): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle with the size changed by the given offset. The
rectangle remains centered around its current center. Negative values
will shrink the rectangle.
<END>


inflate_ip
grow or shrink the rectangle size, in place
Rect.inflate_ip(x, y): return None

Same as the Rect.inflate() method, but operates in place.
<END>



clamp
moves the rectangle inside another
Rect.clamp(Rect): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is moved to be completely inside the argument
Rect. If the rectangle is too large to fit inside, it is centered inside
the argument Rect, but its size is not changed.
<END>



clamp_ip
moves the rectangle inside another, in place
Rect.clamp_ip(Rect): return None

Same as the Rect.clamp() method, but operates in place.
<END>



clip
crops a rectangle inside another
Rect.clip(Rect): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is cropped to be completely inside the
argument Rect. If the two rectangles do not overlap to begin with, a
Rect with 0 size is returned.
<END>


union
joins two rectangles into one
Rect.union(Rect): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle that completely covers the area of the two
provided rectangles. There may be area inside the new Rect that is
not covered by the originals.
<END>



union_ip
joins two rectangles into one, in place
Rect.union_ip(Rect): return None

Same as the Rect.union() method, but operates in place.
<END>



unionall
the union of many rectangles
Rect.unionall(Rect_sequence): return Rect

Returns the union of one rectangle with a sequence of many rectangles.
<END>



unionall_ip
the union of many rectangles, in place
Rect.unionall_ip(Rect_sequence): return None

The same as the Rect.unionall() method, but operates in place.
<END>



fit
resize and move a rectangle with aspect ratio
Rect.fit(Rect): return Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is moved and resized to fit another. The
aspect ratio of the original Rect is preserved, so the new rectangle may
be smaller than the target in either width or height.
<END>



normalize
correct negative sizes
Rect.normalize(): return None

This will flip the width or height of a rectangle if it has a negative
size. The rectangle will remain in the same place, with only the sides
swapped.
<END>



contains
test if one rectangle is inside another
Rect.contains(Rect): return bool

Returns true when the argument is completely inside the Rect.
<END>



collidepoint
test if a point is inside a rectangle
Rect.collidepoint(x, y): return bool
Rect.collidepoint((x,y)): return bool

Returns true if the given point is inside the rectangle. A point along
the right or bottom edge is not considered to be inside the rectangle.
<END>



colliderect
test if two rectangles overlap
Rect.colliderect(Rect): return bool

Returns true if any portion of either rectangle overlap (except
the top+bottom or left+right edges).
<END>



collidelist
test if one rectangle in a list intersects
Rect.collidelist(list): return index

Test whether the rectangle collides with any in a sequence of rectangles.
The index of the first collision found is returned. If no collisions are
found an index of -1 is returned.
<END>



collidelistall
test if all rectangles in a list intersect
Rect.collidelistall(list): return indices

Returns a list of all the indices that contain rectangles that collide
with the Rect. If no intersecting rectangles are found, an empty list
is returned.
<END>



collidedict
test if one rectangle in a dictionary intersects
Rect.collidedict(dict): return (key, value)

Returns the key and value of the first dictionary value that collides
with the Rect. If no collisions are found, None is returned.

Rect objects are not hashable and cannot be used as keys in a dictionary,
only as values.
<END>



collidedictall
test if all rectangles in a dictionary intersect
Rect.collidedictall(dict): return [(key, value), ...]

Returns a list of all the key and value pairs that intersect with the
Rect. If no collisions are found an empty dictionary is returned.

Rect objects are not hashable and cannot be used as keys in a dictionary,
only as values.
<END>
<END>
