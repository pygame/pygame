pygame.mouse
pygame module to work with the mouse

The mouse functions can be used to get the current state of the mouse device.
These functions can also alter the system cursor for the mouse.

When the display mode is set, the event queue will start receiving mouse
events. The mouse buttons generate pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and
pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP events when they are pressed and released. These
events contain a button attribute representing which button was pressed.
The mouse wheel will generate pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN events when rolled.
The button will be set to 4 when the wheel is rolled up, and to button
5 when the wheel is rolled down. Anytime the mouse is moved it generates
a pygame.MOUSEMOTION event. The mouse movement is broken into small
and accurate motion events. As the mouse is moving many motion events will
be placed on the queue. Mouse motion events that are not properly cleaned
from the event queue are the primary reason the event queue fills up.

If the mouse cursor is hidden, and input is grabbed to the current display
the mouse will enter a virtual input mode, where the relative movements
of the mouse will never be stopped by the borders of the screen. See the
functions pygame.mouse.set_visible() and pygame.event.set_grab() to get
this configured.
<SECTION>



get_pressed
get the state of the mouse buttons
pygame.mouse.get_pressed(): return (button1, button2, button3)

Returns a sequence of booleans representing the state of all the mouse
buttons. A true value means the mouse is currently being pressed at the
time of the call.

Note, to get all of the mouse events it is better to use either 
 pygame.event.wait() or pygame.event.get() and check all of those events
to see if they are MOUSEBUTTONDOWN, MOUSEBUTTONUP, or MOUSEMOTION.

Note, that on X11 some XServers use middle button emulation.  When you click
both buttons 1 and 3 at the same time a 2 button event can be emitted.

Note, remember to call pygame.event.get() before this function.  Otherwise 
it will not work.
<END>



get_pos
get the mouse cursor position
pygame.mouse.get_pos(): return (x, y)

Returns the X and Y position of the mouse cursor. The position is relative
the the top-left corner of the display. The cursor position can be located
outside of the display window, but is always constrained to the screen.
<END>



get_rel
get the amount of mouse movement
pygame.mouse.get_rel(): return (x, y)

Returns the amount of movement in X and Y since the previous call to this
function. The relative movement of the mouse cursor is constrained to the
edges of the screen, but see the virtual input mouse mode for a way around
this.  Virtual input mode is described at the top of the page.
<END>



set_pos
set the mouse cursor position
pygame.mouse.set_pos([x, y]): return None

Set the current mouse position to arguments given. If the mouse cursor is
visible it will jump to the new coordinates. Moving the mouse will generate
a new pygaqme.MOUSEMOTION event.
<END>



set_visible
hide or show the mouse cursor
pygame.mouse.set_visible(bool): return bool

If the bool argument is true, the mouse cursor will be visible. This will
return the previous visible state of the cursor.
<END>



get_focused
check if the display is receiving mouse input
pygame.mouse.get_focused(): return bool

Returns true when pygame is receiving mouse input events
(or, in windowing terminology, is "active" or has the "focus").

This method is most useful when working in a window.
By contrast, in full-screen mode, this method
always returns true.

Note: under MS Windows, the window that has the mouse focus
also has the keyboard focus. But under X-Windows, one window
can receive mouse events and another receive keyboard events.
pygame.mouse.get_focused() indicates whether the pygame
window receives mouse events.
<END>



set_cursor
set the image for the system mouse cursor
pygame.mouse.set_cursor(size, hotspot, xormasks, andmasks): return None

When the mouse cursor is visible, it will be displayed as a black and white
bitmap using the given bitmask arrays. The size is a sequence containing
the cursor width and height. Hotspot is a sequence containing the cursor
hotspot position. xormasks is a sequence of bytes containing the cursor
xor data masks. Lastly is andmasks, a sequence of bytes containting the
cursor bitmask data.
 
Width must be a multiple of 8, and the mask arrays must be the correct
size for the given width and height. Otherwise an exception is raised.

See the pygame.cursor module for help creating default and custom 
masks for the system cursor.
<END>



get_cursor
get the image for the system mouse cursor
pygame.mouse.get_cursor(): return (size, hotspot, xormasks, andmasks)

Get the information about the mouse system cursor. The return value is the same data
as the arguments passed into pygame.mouse.set_cursor().
