## How to Contribute to PyGame

Thank you for considering making contribution. There are mainly three kinds of contributions:

1. Write a unit test. Step by step guideline can be found [here](http://renesd.blogspot.com/2019/11/draft-2-of-lets-write-unit-test.html). Write a unit test and run it on different platforms, the more the better, and Python versions. This is a great way to make sure you know how to execute functions properly and things don't break after code changes.
2. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues). The "good first issue" or "Difficulty: Easy" are relatively easier to start with.
3. Compile PyGame from source, speed up PyGame compilation on different platforms, [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Compilation) and [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Hacking) are platform specific instructions.
