<h2 align=center>pygame.event</h2>
Pygame handles all it's event messaging through an event queue.
The routines in this module help you manage that event queue. The
input queue is heavily dependent on the pygame display module. If
the display has not been initialized and a video mode not set,
the event queue will not really work.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The queue is a stack of Event objects, there are a variety of
ways to access the data on the queue. From simply checking for
the existance of events, to grabbing them directly off the stack.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
All events have a type identifier. This event type is in between
the values of NOEVENT and NUMEVENTS. All user defined events can
have the value of USEREVENT or higher. It is recommended make
sure your event id's follow this system.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
To get the state of various input devices, you can forego the
event queue and access the input devices directly with their
appropriate modules; mouse, key, and joystick. If you use this
method, remember that pygame requires some form of communication
with the system window manager and other parts of the platform.
To keep pygame in synch with the system, you will need to call
<a href=#pump>pygame.event.pump()</a> to keep everything current. You'll want to
call this function usually once per game loop.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The event queue offers some simple filtering. This can help
performance slightly by blocking certain event types from the
queue, use the <a href=#set_allowed>pygame.event.set_allowed()</a> and
<a href=#set_blocked>pygame.event.set_blocked()</a> to work with this filtering. All
events default to allowed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Also know that you will not receive any events from a joystick
device, until you have initialized that individual joystick from
the joystick module.<p>&nbsp;</p>An Event object contains an event type and a readonly set of
member data. The Event object contains no method functions, just
member data. Event objects are retrieved from the pygame event
queue. You can create your own new events with the
<a href=#Event>pygame.event.Event()</a> function.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
All Event objects contain an event type identifier in the
Event.type member. You may also get full access to the Event's
member data through the Event.dict method. All other member
lookups will be passed through to the Event's dictionary values.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
While debugging and experimenting, you can print the Event
objects for a quick display of its type and members.
Events that come from the system will have a guaranteed set of
member items based on the type. Here is a list of the Event members
that are defined with each type.<br><table align=center>

<a name=Event><font size=+2><b>Event
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.Event(type, [dict], [keyword_args]) -> Event
</tt></font><ul>
Creates a new event object. The type should be one of SDL's
event numbers, or above USEREVENT. The given dictionary contains
the keys that will be members of the new event.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Also, instead of passing a dictionary to create the event
members, you can pass keyword arguments that will become the
attributes of the new event.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=clear><font size=+2><b>clear
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.clear([type]) -> None
</tt></font><ul>
Pass this a type of event to discard, and it will
remove all matching event types from the queue. If no
types are passed, this will remove all the events from the queue.
You may also optionally pass a sequence of event types. For
example, to remove all the mouse motion events from the queue, you
would call, '<u>pygame.event.clear(MOUSEMOTION)</u>'.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=event_name><font size=+2><b>event_name
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.event_name(event type) -> string
</tt></font><ul>
Returns the standard SDL name for an event type. Mainly helpful
for debugging, when trying to determine what the type of an event
is.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=get><font size=+2><b>get
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.get([type]) -> list of Events
</tt></font><ul>
Pass this a type of event that you are interested in, and it will
return a list of all matching event types from the queue. If no
types are passed, this will return all the events from the queue.
You may also optionally pass a sequence of event types. For
example, to fetch all the keyboard events from the queue, you
would call, '<u>pygame.event.get([KEYDOWN,KEYUP])</u>'.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=get_blocked><font size=+2><b>get_blocked
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.get_blocked(type) -> boolean
</tt></font><ul>
This returns a true value if the given event type is being blocked
from the queue. You can optionally pass a sequence of event types,
and it will return TRUE if any of the types are blocked.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=get_grab><font size=+2><b>get_grab
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.get_grab() -> bool
</tt></font><ul>
Returns true if the input is currently grabbed to your
application.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=peek><font size=+2><b>peek
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.peek([type]) -> bool
</tt></font><ul>
Pass this a type of event that you are interested in, and it will
return true if there are any of that type of event on the queue.
If no types are passed, this will return the next event on the queue
without removing it. You may also optionally pass a sequence of event
types. For example, to find if any keyboard events are on the
queue, you would call, '<u>pygame.event.peek([KEYDOWN,KEYUP])</u>'.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=poll><font size=+2><b>poll
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.poll() -> Event
</tt></font><ul>
Returns next event on queue. If there is no event waiting on the
queue, this will return an event with type NOEVENT.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=post><font size=+2><b>post
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.post(Event) -> None
</tt></font><ul>
This will post your own event objects onto the event queue.
You can past any event type you want, but some care must be
taken. For example, if you post a MOUSEBUTTONDOWN event to the
queue, it is likely any code receiving the event will excpect
the standard MOUSEBUTTONDOWN attributes to be available, like
'pos' and 'button'.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=pump><font size=+2><b>pump
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.pump() -> None
</tt></font><ul>
For each frame of your game, you will need to make some sort
of call to the event queue. This ensures your program can internally
interact with the rest of the operating system. If you are not using
other event functions in your game, you should call <u>pump()</u> to allow
pygame to handle internal actions.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
There are important things that must be dealt with internally in the
event queue. The main window may need to be repainted. Certain joysticks
must be polled for their values. If you fail to make a call to the event
queue for too long, the system may decide your program has locked up.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=set_allowed><font size=+2><b>set_allowed
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.set_allowed(type) -> None
</tt></font><ul>
By default, all events will appear from the queue. After you have
blocked some event types, you can use this to re-enable them. You
can optionally pass a sequence of event types.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
You can pass None and this will allow no events on the queue.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=set_blocked><font size=+2><b>set_blocked
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.set_blocked(type) -> None
</tt></font><ul>
By default, all events will appear from the queue. This will
allow you to prevent event types from appearing on the queue. You
can optionally pass a sequence of event types.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
You can pass None and this will allow all events on the queue.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=set_grab><font size=+2><b>set_grab
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.set_grab(bool) -> None
</tt></font><ul>
Grabs all mouse and keyboard input for the display. Grabbing the
input is not neccessary to receive keyboard and mouse events, but
it ensures all input will go to your application. It also keeps
the mouse locked inside your window. Set the grabbing on or off
with the boolean argument. It is best to not always grab the
input, since it prevents the end user from doing anything else on
their system.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=wait><font size=+2><b>wait
</b></font><br><font size=+1><tt>
pygame.event.wait() -> Event
</tt></font><ul>
Returns the current event on the queue. If there are no messages
waiting on the queue, this will not return until one is
available. Sometimes it is important to use this wait to get
events from the queue, it will allow your application to idle
when the user isn't doing anything with it.
</ul><br>&nbsp;<br>
