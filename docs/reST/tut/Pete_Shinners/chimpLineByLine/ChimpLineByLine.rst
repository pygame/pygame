Introduction
------------

In the *pygame* examples there is a simple example named "chimp".
This example simulates a punchable monkey moving around a small screen with
promises of riches and reward. The example itself is very simple, and a
bit thin on error-checking code. This example program demonstrates many of
pygame's abilities, like creating a graphics window, loading images and sound
files, rendering TTF text, and basic event and mouse handling.

The program and images can be found inside the standard source distribution
of pygame. For version 1.3 of pygame, this example was completely rewritten
to add a couple more features and correct error checking. This about doubled
the size of the original example, but now gives us much more to look at,
as well as the code I can recommend reusing for your own projects.

This tutorial will go through the code block by block. Explaining how
the code works. There will also be mention of how the code could be improved
and what error checking could help out.

This is an excellent tutorial for people getting their first look at
the *pygame* code. Once *pygame* is fully installed, you can find
and run the chimp demo for yourself in the examples directory.

Import Modules
--------------

This is the code that imports all the needed modules into your program.
It also checks for the availability of some of the optional pygame modules. ::

  import os, sys
  import pygame
  from pygame.locals import *

  if not pygame.font: print('Warning, fonts disabled')
  if not pygame.mixer: print('Warning, sound disabled')

First, we import the standard "os" and "sys" python modules. These allow
us to do things like create platform independent file paths.

In the next line, we import the pygame package. When pygame is imported
it imports all the modules belonging to pygame. Some pygame modules are optional,
and if they aren't found, their value is set to `None`.

There is a special *pygame* module named :mod:`locals <pygame.locals>`. This module
contains a subset of *pygame*. The members of this module are commonly
used constants and functions that have proven useful to put into your program's
global namespace.  This locals module includes functions like "Rect" to create
a rectangle object, and many constants like "QUIT, HWSURFACE" that are
used to interact with the rest of *pygame*. Importing the locals module
into the global namespace like this is entirely optional. If you choose
not to import it, all the members of locals are always available in the
*pygame* module.

Lastly, we decide to print a nice warning message if the :mod:`font
<pygame.font>` or :mod:`mixer <pygame.mixer>` modules in pygame are not
available.


Loading Resources
-----------------

Here we have two functions we can use to load images and sounds. We will
look at each function individually in this section. ::

  def load_image(name, colorkey=None):
      fullname = os.path.join('data', name)
      try:
          image = pygame.image.load(fullname)
      except pygame.error as message:
          print('Cannot load image:', name)
          raise SystemExit(message)
      image = image.convert()
      if colorkey is not None:
          if colorkey is -1:
              colorkey = image.get_at((0, 0))
          image.set_colorkey(colorkey, RLEACCEL)
      return image, image.get_rect()

This function takes the name of an image to load. It also optionally
takes an argument it can use to set a colorkey for the image. A colorkey
is used in graphics to represent a color of the image that is transparent.

The first thing this function does is create a full pathname to the file.
In this example all the resources are in a "data" subdirectory. By using
the `os.path.join` function, a pathname will be created that works for whatever
platform the game is running on.

Next we load the image using the :func:`pygame.image.load` function. We wrap
this function in a try/except block, so if there is a problem loading the
image, we can exit gracefully. After the image is loaded, we make an important
call to the `convert()` function. This makes a new copy of a Surface and converts
its color format and depth to match the display. This means blitting the
image to the screen will happen as quickly as possible.

Last, we set the colorkey for the image. If the user supplied an argument
for the colorkey argument we use that value as the colorkey for the image.
This would usually just be a color RGB value, like (255, 255, 255) for
white.  You can also pass a value of -1 as the colorkey. In this case the
function will lookup the color at the topleft pixel of the image, and use
that color for the colorkey. ::

  def load_sound(name):
      class NoneSound:
          def play(self): pass
      if not pygame.mixer:
          return NoneSound()
      fullname = os.path.join('data', name)
      try:
          sound = pygame.mixer.Sound(fullname)
      except pygame.error as message:
          print('Cannot load sound:', wav)
          raise SystemExit(message)
      return sound

Next is the function to load a sound file. The first thing this function
does is check to see if the :mod:`pygame.mixer` module was imported correctly.
If not, it returns a small class instance that has a dummy play method.
This will act enough like a normal Sound object for this game to run without
any extra error checking.

This function is similar to the image loading function, but handles some
different problems. First we create a full path to the sound image, and
load the sound file inside a try/except block. Then we simply return the
loaded Sound object.


Game Object Classes
-------------------

Here we create two classes to represent the objects in our game. Almost
all the logic for the game goes into these two classes. We will look over
them one at a time here. ::

  class Fist(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
      """moves a clenched fist on the screen, following the mouse"""
      def __init__(self):
          pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)  # call Sprite initializer
          self.image, self.rect = load_image('fist.bmp', -1)
          self.punching = 0

      def update(self):
          """move the fist based on the mouse position"""
          pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
          self.rect.midtop = pos
          if self.punching:
              self.rect.move_ip(5, 10)

      def punch(self, target):
          """returns true if the fist collides with the target"""
          if not self.punching:
              self.punching = 1
              hitbox = self.rect.inflate(-5, -5)
              return hitbox.colliderect(target.rect)

      def unpunch(self):
          """called to pull the fist back"""
          self.punching = 0

Here we create a class to represent the players fist. It is derived from
the `Sprite` class included in the :mod:`pygame.sprite` module. The `__init__` function
is called when new instances of this class are created. The first thing
we do is be sure to call the `__init__` function for our base class. This
allows the Sprite's `__init__` function to prepare our object for use as a
sprite.  This game uses one of the sprite drawing Group classes. These classes
can draw sprites that have an "image" and "rect" attribute. By simply changing
these two attributes, the renderer will draw the current image at the current
position.

All sprites have an `update()` method. This function is typically called
once per frame. It is where you should put code that moves and updates
the variables for the sprite. The `update()` method for the fist moves the
fist to the location of the mouse pointer. It also offsets the fist position
slightly if the fist is in the "punching" state.

The following two functions `punch()` and `unpunch()` change the punching
state for the fist. The `punch()` method also returns a true value if the fist
is colliding with the given target sprite. ::

  class Chimp(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
      """moves a monkey critter across the screen. it can spin the
         monkey when it is punched."""
      def __init__(self):
          pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)  # call Sprite intializer
          self.image, self.rect = load_image('chimp.bmp', -1)
          screen = pygame.display.get_surface()
          self.area = screen.get_rect()
          self.rect.topleft = 10, 10
          self.move = 9
          self.dizzy = 0

      def update(self):
          """walk or spin, depending on the monkeys state"""
          if self.dizzy:
              self._spin()
          else:
              self._walk()

      def _walk(self):
          """move the monkey across the screen, and turn at the ends"""
          newpos = self.rect.move((self.move, 0))
          if not self.area.contains(newpos):
              if self.rect.left < self.area.left or \
                      self.rect.right > self.area.right:
                  self.move = -self.move
                  newpos = self.rect.move((self.move, 0))
                  self.image = pygame.transform.flip(self.image, 1, 0)
              self.rect = newpos

      def _spin(self):
          """spin the monkey image"""
          center = self.rect.center
          self.dizzy += 12
          if self.dizzy >= 360:
              self.dizzy = 0
              self.image = self.original
          else:
              rotate = pygame.transform.rotate
              self.image = rotate(self.original, self.dizzy)
          self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=center)

      def punched(self):
          """this will cause the monkey to start spinning"""
          if not self.dizzy:
              self.dizzy = 1
              self.original = self.image

The `Chimp` class is doing a little more work than the fist, but nothing
more complex. This class will move the chimp back and forth across the
screen.  When the monkey is punched, he will spin around to exciting effect.
This class is also derived from the base :class:`Sprite <pygame.sprite.Sprite>`
class, and is initialized the same as the fist. While initializing, the class
also sets the attribute "area" to be the size of the display screen.

The `update` function for the chimp simply looks at the current "dizzy"
state, which is true when the monkey is spinning from a punch. It calls either
the `_spin` or `_walk` method. These functions are prefixed with an underscore.
This is just a standard python idiom which suggests these methods should
only be used by the `Chimp` class. We could go so far as to give them a double
underscore, which would tell python to really try to make them private
methods, but we don't need such protection. :)

The `_walk` method creates a new position for the monkey by moving the current
rect by a given offset. If this new position crosses outside the display
area of the screen, it reverses the movement offset. It also mirrors the
image using the :func:`pygame.transform.flip` function. This is a crude effect
that makes the monkey look like he's turning the direction he is moving.

The `_spin` method is called when the monkey is currently "dizzy". The dizzy
attribute is used to store the current amount of rotation. When the monkey
has rotated all the way around (360 degrees) it resets the monkey image
back to the original, non-rotated version. Before calling the
:func:`pygame.transform.rotate` function, you'll see the code makes a local
reference to the function simply named "rotate". There is no need to do that
for this example, it is just done here to keep the following line's length a
little shorter. Note that when calling the `rotate` function, we are always
rotating from the original monkey image. When rotating, there is a slight loss
of quality. Repeatedly rotating the same image and the quality would get worse
each time. Also, when rotating an image, the size of the image will actually
change. This is because the corners of the image will be rotated out, making
the image bigger. We make sure the center of the new image matches the center
of the old image, so it rotates without moving.

The last method is `punched()` which tells the sprite to enter its dizzy
state.  This will cause the image to start spinning. It also makes a copy
of the current image named "original".


Initialize Everything
---------------------

Before we can do much with pygame, we need to make sure its modules
are initialized. In this case we will also open a simple graphics window.
Now we are in the `main()` function of the program, which actually runs everything. ::

  pygame.init()
  screen = pygame.display.set_mode((468, 60))
  pygame.display.set_caption('Monkey Fever')
  pygame.mouse.set_visible(0)

The first line to initialize *pygame* takes care of a bit of
work for us. It checks through the imported *pygame* modules and attempts
to initialize each one of them. It is possible to go back and check if modules
failed to initialize, but we won't bother here. It is also possible to
take a lot more control and initialize each specific module by hand. That
type of control is generally not needed, but is available if you desire.

Next we set up the display graphics mode. Note that the pygame.display
module is used to control all the display settings. In this case we are
asking for a simple skinny window. There is an entire separate tutorial
on setting up the graphics mode, but if we really don't care, *pygame*
will do a good job of getting us something that works. Pygame will pick
the best color depth, since we haven't provided one.

Last we set the window title and turn off the mouse cursor for our
window.  Very basic to do, and now we have a small black window ready to
do our bidding.  Usually the cursor defaults to visible, so there is no need
to really set the state unless we want to hide it.


Create The Background
---------------------

Our program is going to have text message in the background. It would
be nice for us to create a single surface to represent the background and
repeatedly use that. The first step is to create the surface. ::

  background = pygame.Surface(screen.get_size())
  background = background.convert()
  background.fill((250, 250, 250))

This creates a new surface for us that is the same size as the display
window. Note the extra call to `convert()` after creating the Surface. The
convert with no arguments will make sure our background is the same format
as the display window, which will give us the fastest results.

We also fill the entire background with a solid whitish color. Fill
takes an RGB triplet as the color argument.


Put Text On The Background, Centered
------------------------------------

Now that we have a background surface, lets get the text rendered to it. We
only do this if we see the :mod:`pygame.font` module has imported properly.
If not, we just skip this section. ::

  if pygame.font:
      font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
      text = font.render("Pummel The Chimp, And Win $$$", 1, (10, 10, 10))
      textpos = text.get_rect(centerx=background.get_width()/2)
      background.blit(text, textpos)

As you see, there are a couple steps to getting this done. First we
must create the font object and render it into a new surface. We then find
the center of that new surface and blit (paste) it onto the background.

The font is created with the `font` module's `Font()` constructor. Usually
you will pass the name of a TrueType font file to this function, but we
can also pass `None`, which will use a default font. The `Font` constructor
also needs to know the size of font we want to create.

We then render that font into a new surface. The `render` function creates
a new surface that is the appropriate size for our text. In this case
we are also telling render to create antialiased text (for a nice smooth
look) and to use a dark grey color.

Next we need to find the centered position of the text on our display.
We create a "Rect" object from the text dimensions, which allows us to
easily assign it to the screen center.

Finally we blit (blit is like a copy or paste) the text onto the background
image.


Display The Background While Setup Finishes
-------------------------------------------

We still have a black window on the screen. Lets show our background
while we wait for the other resources to load. ::

  screen.blit(background, (0, 0))
  pygame.display.flip()

This will blit our entire background onto the display window. The
blit is self explanatory, but what about this flip routine?

In pygame, changes to the display surface are not immediately visible.
Normally, a display must be updated in areas that have changed for them
to be visible to the user. With double buffered displays the display must
be swapped (or flipped) for the changes to become visible. In this case
the `flip()` function works nicely because it simply handles the entire window
area and handles both single- and double-buffered surfaces.


Prepare Game Object
-------------------

Here we create all the objects that the game is going to need.

::

  whiff_sound = load_sound('whiff.wav')
  punch_sound = load_sound('punch.wav')
  chimp = Chimp()
  fist = Fist()
  allsprites = pygame.sprite.RenderPlain((fist, chimp))
  clock = pygame.time.Clock()

First we load two sound effects using the `load_sound` function we defined
above. Then we create an instance of each of our sprite classes. And lastly
we create a sprite :class:`Group <pygame.sprite.Group>` which will contain all
our sprites.

We actually use a special sprite group named :class:`RenderPlain
<pygame.sprite.RenderPlain>`. This sprite group can draw all the sprites it
contains to the screen. It is called `RenderPlain` because there are actually
more advanced Render groups. But for our game, we just need simple drawing. We
create the group named "allsprites" by passing a list with all the sprites that
should belong in the group. We could later on add or remove sprites from this
group, but in this game we won't need to.

The `clock` object we create will be used to help control our game's framerate.
we will use it in the main loop of our game to make sure it doesn't run too fast.


Main Loop
---------

Nothing much here, just an infinite loop. ::

  while 1:
      clock.tick(60)

All games run in some sort of loop. The usual order of things is to
check on the state of the computer and user input, move and update the
state of all the objects, and then draw them to the screen. You'll see
that this example is no different.

We also make a call to our `clock` object, which will make sure our game
doesn't run faster than 60 frames per second.


Handle All Input Events
-----------------------

This is an extremely simple case of working the event queue. ::

  for event in pygame.event.get():
      if event.type == QUIT:
          return
      elif event.type == KEYDOWN and event.key == K_ESCAPE:
          return
      elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
          if fist.punch(chimp):
              punch_sound.play()  # punch
              chimp.punched()
          else:
              whiff_sound.play()  # miss
      elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONUP:
          fist.unpunch()

First we get all the available Events from pygame and loop through each
of them. The first two tests see if the user has quit our game, or pressed
the escape key. In these cases we just return from the `main()` function and
the program cleanly ends.

Next we just check to see if the mouse button was pressed or released.
If the button was pressed, we ask the fist object if it has collided with
the chimp. We play the appropriate sound effect, and if the monkey was hit,
we tell him to start spinning (by calling his `punched()` method).


Update the Sprites
------------------

::

  allsprites.update()

Sprite groups have an `update()` method, which simply calls the update method
for all the sprites it contains. Each of the objects will move around, depending
on which state they are in. This is where the chimp will move one step side
to side, or spin a little farther if he was recently punched.


Draw The Entire Scene
---------------------

Now that all the objects are in the right place, time to draw them. ::

  screen.blit(background, (0, 0))
  allsprites.draw(screen)
  pygame.display.flip()

The first blit call will draw the background onto the entire screen. This
erases everything we saw from the previous frame (slightly inefficient, but
good enough for this game). Next we call the `draw()` method of the sprite
container. Since this sprite container is really an instance of the "DrawPlain"
sprite group, it knows how to draw our sprites. Lastly, we `flip()` the contents
of pygame's software double buffer to the screen. This makes everything we've
drawn visible all at once.


Game Over
---------

User has quit, time to clean up.

Cleaning up the running game in *pygame* is extremely simple.
In fact since all variables are automatically destructed, we really don't
have to do anything.
