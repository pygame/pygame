## Pygame Joystick Troubleshooting

# Ubuntu System

In certain systems, Pygame fails to detect joystick devices which is caused due to the system encountering Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) related issues. The ALSA errors suggest that there might be an issue with the in-built sound card configuration. 


Resolving this involves checking and verifying the correctness of the sound card configuration by checking on the speaker icon in the top right corner of the screen and confirming that the audio output and input devices are set up correctly. This can further lead to troubleshooting the ALSA configuration or checking for driver-related issues with the sound card in case of a problem. Additionally, the joystick package has to be installed using the command - 

```
sudo apt-get install -y joystick
```

After this, it is essential to install the necessary ALSA development libraries and verify the joystick configuration in the system. 
This is done using the command - 

```
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev
```

Consequently, Pygame would have to be reinstalled to access the latest version and correctly configure all dependencies.

```
pip3 uninstall pygame
pip3 install pygame
```
