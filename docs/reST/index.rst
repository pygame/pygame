  Pygame used the NumPy python module to allow efficient per pixel effects on images.
  Using the surface arrays is an advanced feature that allows custom effects and filters.
  This also examines some of the simple effects from the pygame example, arraydemo.py.

  Pygame, as of 1.9, has a camera module that allows you to capture images,
  watch live streams, and do some basic computer vision.
  This tutorial covers those use cases.
