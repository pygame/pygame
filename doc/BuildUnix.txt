Building Pygame2 on Unix
========================
Building Pygame2 on Unix compatible platforms, such as Linux or BSD, is
probably the easiest way of having a fully featured multimedia framework

Setting the environment
-----------------------
You will need a mostly C99 compatible compiler such as the GNU C
Compiler and (optionally) a make utility such as GNU make or pmake.

Building the dependencies
-------------------------
.. note::

    The following list of dependencies might not be the most actual one.
    Please check the README.txt file in the top source directory for the
    most actual dependency list!

Make sure, you have at least one of the following Python versions installed:

* Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.1 (http://www.python.org)

To build anything, you will have to download the following additional source
packages:

* SDL >= 1.2.10              (http://www.libsdl.org)
* SDL_mixer >= 1.2.11        (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
* SDL_ttf >= 2.0.9           (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
* SDL_image >= 1.2.10        (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
* SDL_gfx >= 2.0.18          (http://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_gfx-2.0/)
* libpng >= 1.2.24           (http://www.libpng.org)
* libjpeg >= 6b              (http://www.ijg.org/)
* freetype >= 2.3.5          (http://www.freetype.org)
* portmidi >= 199            (http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/)

And you will need the dependency packages for the packages above:

* zlib >= 1.2.3              (http://www.zlib.net)
* tiff >= 3.8.2              (http://libtiff.org)
* libvorbis >= 1.2.0         (http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/)
* libogg >= 1.1.3            (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/)
* FLAC >= 1.2.1              (http://flac.sourceforge.net)
* smpeg >= rev. 370          (http://icculus.org/smpeg/)

The next step would be to build and install those dependencies in the
correct order as required by your specific operating system. Once done
with it, you can go on to build Pygame2.

Building Pygame2
----------------
Now that all dependencies are built and installed, you can proceed to
build and install Pygame2 itself. You can either use the python way of
installing the package or the make command using the Makefile.

Simply type ::

  python setup.py install 

for the traditional python way or ::

  make install

for using the Makefile. This will try to perform a default installation
with as many features as possible.
