  <short>extended SDL drawing methods</short>
  <desc>Extension module containing simple 2D drawing methods for the pygame2
    SDL modules. Several methods utilize code from the SDL_gfx library, and 
    were optimised and changed in several ways.

  <func name="aaline">
    <call>aaline (surface, color, x1, y1, x2, y2[, blend]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`
    aaline (surface, color, point1, point2[, blend]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`</call>
    <desc>Draws a fine anti-aliased line.
      
      Draws an anti-aliased line on a *surface*. If *blend* is True, the
      shades will be be blended with existing pixel shades instead of
      overwriting them.
      
      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by
      the changes.

  <func name="aalines">
    <call>aalines (surface, color, (point1, point2, ...) [, blend]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`
    </call>
    <desc>Draws multiple contiguous anti-aliased line segments on a surface.
    
      Draws a sequence of anti-aliased lines with a fixed width of 1px
      on a *surface*. If *blend* is True, the shades will be be blended
      with existing pixel shades instead of overwriting them.

      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by
      the changes.

  <func name="aapolygon">
    <call>aapolygon (surface, color, (point1, point2, ...) [, blend]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`
    </call>
    <desc>Draws an anti-aliased polygonal shape on a surface.
    
      Draws an polygonal shape on a *surface* with an fixed line width of
      1px. If *blend* is true, the shades will be be blended with existing
      pixel shades instead of overwriting them.
      
      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by the
      changes.

  <func name="arc">
    <call>arc (surface, color, rect, startangle, stopangle[, width]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`
    </call>
    <desc>Draws an elliptical arc on a surface.
    
      Draws an elliptical arc on a *surface* with an optionally
      specified line width. If the *width* argument is omitted, the line
      will be 1px thick. If *width* is set to 0, a filled shape will be
      drawn. The *startangle* and *stopangle* arguments are the initial
      and final angle in degrees.
      
      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by the
      changes.

  <func name="circle">
    <call>circle (surface, color, x, y, radius[, width]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`
    circle (surface, color, point, radius[, width]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`</call>
    <desc>Draws a circular shape on a surface.
    
      Draws a circular shape on a *surface* with an optionally specified
      line width. If the *width* argument is omitted, the line will be
      1px thick. If *width* is set to 0, a filled circular shape will be
      drawn. The *x*, *y* point denotes the center of the circle.
      
      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by the
      changes.

  <func name="ellipse">
    <call>ellipse (surface, color, rect[, width]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`</call>
    <desc>Draws an elliptical shape on a surface.
    
      Draws an elliptical shape on a *surface* with an optionally
      specified line width. If the *width* argument is omitted, the line
      will be 1px thick. If *width* is set to 0, a filled elliptical
      shape will be drawn. The passed :class:`pygame2.Rect` denotes the
      area, the elliptical shape will be drawn in.
      
      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by the
      changes.

    line (surface, color, point1, point2[, width]) -> :class:`pygame2.Rect`</call>
    <desc>Draws a straight line segment on a surface.

      Draws a straight line segment on a *surface* with an optionally
      specified line width. If the *width* argument is omitted, the line
      will be 1px thick. There are no endcaps, the ends are squared off
      for thick lines.
      
      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by the

    <desc>Draws multiple contiguous line segments on a surface.
    
      Draws a sequence of lines on a *surface* with an optionally
      specified line width. If the *width* argument is omitted, the
      lines will be 1px thick.

      The returned :class:`pygame2.Rect` describes the area affected by the
