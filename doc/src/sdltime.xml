  <func name="add_timer">
    <call>add_timer (interval, callable[, data]) -> CObject</call>
    <desc>
      Adds a timer callback to be called periodically.
      
      Adds a timer callback to be called periodically using the specified
      *interval*. *callable* can be any callable objet, method or function. On
      invocation, the optional *data* will be passed to the callable.
      
      This will return an CObject that acts as unique id for the timer callback.
    </desc>
  </func>
  <func name="delay">
    <call>delay (time) -> None</call>
    <desc>
      Delays the execution for a specific time.
      
      Delays the program execution for a specific *time*. The *time* is
      expressed in milliseconds.

      .. note::

        This does *not* require :meth:`init` to be called before.

  </func>
  <func name="get_ticks">
    <call>get_ticks () -> long</call>
    <desc>
      Gets the number of milliseconds since the initialization of the underlying
      SDL library.
      
      Gets the number of milliseconds since the initialization of the underlying
      SDL library. The value will wrap if the program runs for more than ~49
      days.
    </desc>
  </func>
  <func name="init">
    <call>init () -> None</call>
    <desc>
      Initializes the timer subsystem of the SDL library.
    </desc>
  </func>
  <func name="quit">
    <call>quit () -> None</call>
    <desc>
      Shuts down the timer subsystem of the SDL library.

      After calling this function, you should not invoke any class,
      method or function related to the timer subsystem as they are
      likely to fail or might give unpredictable results.
    </desc>
  </func>
  <func name="remove_timer">
    <call>remove_timer (timerobj) -> None</call>
    <desc>
      Removes a previously added timer callback.
      
      Removes a previously added timer callback and throws an exception, if the
      passed object is not a matching timer object.
    </desc>
  </func>
  <func name="set_timer">
    <call>set_timer (interval, callable) -> None</call>
    <desc>
      Sets a single timer callback to be called periodically.
      
      Sets a single timer callback to be called periodically using the specified
      *interval* in milliseconds. The timer callback can be reset by passing
      None as *callable* object.
    </desc>
  </func>
  <func name="was_init">
    <call>was_init () -> bool</call>
    <desc>
      Returns, whether the timer subsystem of the SDL library is initialized.
    </desc>
  </func>
