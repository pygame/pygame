C API
-----
The C API contains numerous macros and functions that ease the
developer's life. In order to have a similar behaviour without
implementing the same things again and again, those will be listed here.

base/pgdefines.h contains some useful numeric macros:

  MIN(x,y)       - returns the minimum of two values
  MAX(x,y)       - returns the maximum of two values
  ABS(x)         - returns the absolute value
  trunc(x)       - truncates a number
  round(x)       - rounds a number
  DEG2RAD        - converts degrees to radians
  DEG2RAD        - converts radians to degrees
  ADD_LIMIT(x,y) - variable addition using overflow limits
  SUB_LIMIT(x,y) - variable subtraction using overflow limits

Besides that it contains various ready-to-use macros for signed/unsigned
integer and double additions and subtractions with overflow checking.

Additionally base/pgbase.h contains several functions to get an integer
or floating point value from a PyObject. Those however require other
modules to import the base module.

* SDL Rectangles *

sdl/pgsdl.h defines some handy routines to quickly get a SDL_Rect from
the base.Rect and base.FRect classes, SDLRect_FromRect(). Use it
wherever methods require a rectangular object. IsValidRect() checks only,
whether the passed argument is a base.Rect or base.FRect.

* SDL surface pixel manipulation *

sdl/surface.h contains tons of macros to manipulate surface pixels. It
should be your first address to look for a matching operation whenever
you need it.

* SDL color handling *

The Color class uses an ARGB layout for PyColor_AsNumber(). In order to
prepare this value for color operations within the SDL functions or
pixel manipulations, use the RGB2FORMAT() and ARGB2FORMAT() macros,
defined in sdl/surface.h.

* SDL subsystems *

Whenever you require a certain subsystem to be available, use the
corresponding ASSERT_***_INIT() macro from sdl/pgsdl.h.
