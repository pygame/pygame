Manylinux wheels
================

This is for building linux binary wheels. So "pip install pygame" works on linux.

The *manylinux1* tag (see `PEP 513 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/>`__)
refers to a specific set of core library minimum versions, which most recent
desktop Linux distros have.
To ensure that our libraries are ABI-compatible with these core libraries, we
build on an old Linux distribution in a docker container.

manylinux is an older linux with a fairly compatable ABI, so you can make linux binary
wheels that run on many different linux distros.

The basic idea is that we build the pygame dependencies, and then bundle them up in a .whl file.
We make base images containing the dependencies (but not pygame itself), so that
we can rebuild pygame without building all the dependencies every time.

This is easiest on a Linux machine with the Docker daemon running. To get the
prebuilt base images with pygame dependencies::

    make pull-x64    # 64 bit, or
    make pull-x86    # 32 bit, or
    make pull        # Both

Then build the wheels::

    make wheels-x64  # 64 bit, or
    make wheels-x86  # 32 bit, or
    make wheels      # both

The wheels will be created in a directory called ``wheelhouse``.

If you have changed the files in ``docker_base``, e.g. to add or update
dependencies, you will need to rebuild the Docker base images::

    make base-image-x64  # 64 bit, or
    make base-image-x86  # 32 bit, or
    make base-images     # both


Virtual Machine
---------------

Below are instructions on using a vagrant virtual machine, so we can build the wheels from
mac, windows or linux boxes.


These aren't meant to be copypasta'd in. Perhaps these can be worked into a script later::

    # You should be in the base of the pygame repo when you run all this.
    $ pwd
    /home/jblogs/pygame

    # Download many megabytes of ubuntu.
    mkdir vagrant.xenial64
    cd vagrant.xenial64
    vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64

    # edit your Vagrantfile to add /vagrant_pygame synced folder.
    # You pygame folder is next to your vagrant
    config.vm.synced_folder "../pygame", "/vagrant_pygame"

    # now start vagrant.
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

    # now we are on the vagrant ubuntu host
    # We set up docker following these instructions for ubuntu-xenial
    # https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce-1
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

    # Now edit /etc/hosts so it has a first line with the hostname ubuntu-xenial in it.
    # Otherwise docker does not start.
    # 127.0.0.1 localhost ubuntu-xenial
    # makes a /etc/hosts.bak in case something breaks.
    sudo sed -i".bak" '/127.0.0.1 localhost/s/$/ ubuntu-xenial/' /etc/hosts

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

    sudo apt-get install docker-ce

    # check that it runs.
    sudo docker run hello-world


    # We should have been in our python package clone root directory before we ran vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant_pygame

    # We need to be able to run docker as the ubuntu user.
    sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

    # now log out of vagrant. Need to reload it because docker.
    exit

    vagrant reload
    vagrant ssh

    # now we can start docker. Should be started already.
    sudo service docker start


    cd /vagrant_pygame/buildconfig/manylinux-build

    # To make the base docker images and push them to docker hub do these commands.
    # Note, these have already been built, so only needed if rebuilding dependencies.
    # https://hub.docker.com/u/pygame/
    #make base-images
    #make push

    # We use the prebuilt docker images, which should be quicker.
    make wheels

    # List the wheels we've built
    ls -la wheelhouse

    # Testing
    export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=disk
    export SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy

    python3.5 -m venv anenv35
    . ./anenv35/bin/activate
    pip install wheelhouse/pygame-*cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
    python -m pygame.tests --exclude opengl,music


    # Now upload all the linux wheels to pypi.
    # Make sure your PYPI vars are set. See .travis_osx_upload_whl.py
    # Note you will need to increment the version in setup.py first.
    cd ..
    mkdir -p dist
    rm -f dist/*.whl
    cp buildconfig/manylinux-build/wheelhouse/*.whl dist/

    pip install twine

    twine upload dist/*.whl --user=pygameci


Getting a shell
---------------

To be able to run bash:

    docker run --name manylinux2010_base_x86_64 -it pygame/manylinux2010_base_x86_64
    docker run --name manylinux2010_base_i686 -it pygame/manylinux2010_base_i686

    docker run --name manylinux1_base_x86_64 -it pygame/manylinux1_base_x86_64
    docker run --name manylinux1_base_i686 -it pygame/manylinux1_base_i686


To copy the config.log file off there into a SDL2-2.0.12/config.log locally:

    docker run pygame/manylinux1_base_i686 tar -c -C /sdl_build SDL2-2.0.12/config.log | tar x

Maybe these need adding?
